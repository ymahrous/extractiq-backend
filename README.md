## The Problem

Standard web APIs have a hard limit: if a server doesn't respond within ~30 seconds, the connection is dropped. AI document extraction can easily take 10–30 seconds per file. Naive implementations fail under real-world load.

edocAI solves this with an asynchronous producer-consumer architecture: the API responds in ~100ms, and a background worker does the heavy lifting independently.

### AI Extraction Pipeline

The worker downloads the uploaded file from object storage. If it's a PDF, the first page is rasterized into a high-resolution PNG using PyMuPDF; image files pass through unchanged. The resulting image is sent to **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** via the Interactions API for vision-based extraction, returning strictly typed JSON (`vendor`, `total_amount`, `date`).

If extraction fails for any reason, the document's status is set to `FAILED` and the error is logged — there is currently no secondary extraction strategy.

## API Reference

All routes are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

### Authentication

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/auth/signup` | Create an account. Returns a bearer token. |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Authenticate. Returns a bearer token. |
| `POST` | `/auth/change-password` | Change password. Requires current password. |
| `DELETE` | `/auth/delete` | Permanently delete the authenticated user. |

### Documents

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/upload/` | Upload a document (multipart). Returns immediately; processing happens in the background. |
| `GET` | `/documents/` | List all documents owned by the authenticated user. |
| `GET` | `/extraction/{document_id}` | Retrieve the structured extraction for a completed document. 404 if not yet processed. |

All document and extraction routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and are scoped to the authenticated user via `owner_id`.

---

## Security Model

**Authentication**: Stateless JWTs signed with HS256, verified on every request via FastAPI's `HTTPBearer` dependency. No server-side sessions.

**Data Isolation**: Every document query is filtered by `owner_id == current_user.id` at the query level. Users cannot list or fetch documents they don't own.

**Password Hashing**: Uses the `bcrypt` library directly (not `passlib`), generating a fresh salt per password via `bcrypt.gensalt()`.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Postgres database (e.g. [Neon](https://neon.tech))
- A Redis instance (e.g. [Upstash](https://upstash.com))
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project with a storage bucket
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) API key

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymahrous/edocai-backend.git
cd edocai-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` with your database, Redis, Supabase, and Gemini credentials.

### Running

Run the API:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Run the Celery worker (separate terminal):
```bash
celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

Or use the `Makefile` if targets are defined for both.

API docs are available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` (FastAPI's automatic Swagger UI).

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```

Test configuration lives in `pytest.ini`, with shared fixtures in `conftest.py`.

---

## Deployment

1. Connect this repository to [Railway](https://railway.app).
2. Railway reads `Procfile` and deploys two services from it: `web` (FastAPI) and `worker` (Celery).
3. Set environment variables in the Railway dashboard — see `.env.example` for the full list.
4. `railway.toml` configures build/deploy behavior.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string (Neon) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing secret |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon/public API key |
| `SUPABASE_BUCKET_NAME` | Storage bucket for uploaded documents |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_ENDPOINT` | Upstash Redis host |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_PASSWORD` | Upstash Redis password |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio API key |

## Key Decisions

**Why Celery + Redis instead of background threads or `asyncio.create_task`?** Long-running AI inference work needs to survive process restarts and scale independently of the API's request-handling capacity. A dedicated worker process, decoupled via a message broker, allows the `web` and `worker` Railway services to scale separately.

**Why raw `bcrypt` instead of `passlib`?** `passlib`'s bcrypt backend has had compatibility issues on some platforms. Calling `bcrypt` directly removes a dependency layer and keeps the hashing logic explicit.

**Why rasterize PDFs instead of extracting text directly?** Gemini's vision capability handles messy, non-machine-readable invoice layouts (scanned documents, photos of receipts) far better than raw text extraction, which fails on receipts with unusual formatting or embedded images.

**Why SQLModel over plain SQLAlchemy?** SQLModel combines Pydantic validation with SQLAlchemy's ORM in a single model definition, reducing duplication between API schemas and database tables in a small codebase like this one.

---

## Limitations

- No password-reset flow for forgotten passwords (only authenticated password change)
- No endpoint to delete individual documents
- No retry or fallback strategy if Gemini extraction fails — the document is simply marked `FAILED`
- CORS currently allows all origins (`allow_origins=["*"]`); should be restricted to the deployed frontend domain before wider production use
